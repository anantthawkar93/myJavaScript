    <title>Closure Example-1</title>
    <!--
        A closure is a special kind of variable that combinees a function, 
        and the environment in which that function was created. 
        the environment consists of all local variables that were in-scope at that time
        that when the closure was created. lets understand it in details. 
        Note that though innerfunc is private function, 
        if we reture it we can access it from outside the outerfunc. 
        Along with it, this return innerfunc comes with the environment of the function that it has created. 
        Thats why  -->
