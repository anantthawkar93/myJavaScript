        function sayWord(word){
            return () => console.log(word);
        }
        const sayHello = sayWord("Hello");
        sayHello();
        /*
        There are 2 interesting point to notice:
        1: The returned function from sayWord can access the word parameter.
        2: The returned function maintain the value of "word"  when sayHello is called outside the scope of word.

        The first point can be explained by lexical scope:
        Lexical Scope: The returned function can access the "word" before it exits in its outer scope.

        The Second point becoz of Closures:
        A Closure is a function combined with reference to variables defined outside of it.

        Closure maintain the variable references, which allows function to access variables outside of their scope.

        They "Enclose" the function and variable in its environment.

        Example of Closures in JS:
        1: Callbacks => It is comman for a callback to reference or variable declared outside of itself.
        */

       function getCars(make){
           return cars.filter(x => x, make == make)
       }
       
       //make is available in callback because of lexical scoping and 
       //"make" is persisted when filter called becoz of closure.

       /*2:Storing state => We can use closures from functions that stores states.
       let's say a function which returns an object that can Store and change name.
        */

       function makePerson(name){
           let _name = name;
           return {
               setName: (newName) => (_name = newName),
               getName: () => _name,
           };
       }
       const me = makePerson("anant");
       console.log(me.getName());

       me.setName("thawkar");
       console.log(me.getName());

       /*It shows how closure donot freeze values of variables from function's outer scope during creation,
       instead they maintain the references through-out closures lifetime.
       */

       /*Private Methods:
       So, In OOPs concept, in a class,  we have private state AND  exposed getter and setter methods public.
       We can extend this OOPs; 
       */

       function makePerson1(name){
           let _name = name;

           function privateSetName(newName){
               let _name = newName;
           }
           return {
               setName: (newName) => privateSetName(newName),
               getName: () => _name,
           };
       }
       let  meNew = makePerson1("anant");
       console.log(meNew.getName());
       meNew.setName("thawkar");
       console.log(meNew.getName());

       /*So privateSetName is not directly accessible to consumers and 
       it can access the private state variable _name through closure.

       Closure make it possible for : functions to maintain connections with outer variables, 
       even outside scope of the variables.

       There are many uses of closures from creating class like structures, that store states and implements
       private methods to pass callbacks to event handlers.
